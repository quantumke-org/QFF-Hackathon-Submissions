## Concept Description
The Quantum Time Capsule is an interactive Streamlit web application that integrates
Qiskit quantum simulations within a dynamic, timeline-based interface. It demonstrates
how quantum computing frameworks can be combined with modern web technologies to create
an engaging educational platform.

## How it works
Each timeline entry represents a key quantum concept implemented as a modular Qiskit 
simulation. These include circuits demonstrating superposition and interference
using Hadamard gates, probabilistic measurements for Schrödinger’s Cat, entanglement
and Bell states to explore non-locality, and quantum random number generation for 
futuristic prediction models.

The Streamlit frontend manages user interaction, visualization, and circuit 
execution. When users trigger a simulation, Qiskit constructs and runs the 
circuit using Aer simulators, returning circuit diagrams, probability histograms,
and measurement outcomes rendered directly in the app. The system architecture 
is designed for modularity and scalability, allowing easy addition of new 
experiments and features.

It includes AI-generated narrations, voice synthesis, 
and adaptive storytelling powered by language models, enriching both accessibility
and engagement.

Overall, the Quantum Time Capsule showcases the fusion of quantum computation
and interactive web technologies, offering a technically robust and visually 
intuitive way to explore foundational principles of quantum mechanics.
